First let's evaluate the reasons behind [Cozeit](http://cozeit.com) in the first place.

## History

Cozeit stands for cozy technologies that is delivered in timely manner.

Cozy Tech an idea that started early 2010, because a given system does 
need to speak it's users

Because the user is the key success factor for any given system, be it
if you have developed the most technologically advanced system or straight up
rocket engine, if the user cannot reasonably use the system with ease then 
by all means it is a failure.

Because it doesn't matter how well you built the underlying architecture of 
a system, if a user is struggling to achieve results, and you been able to
deliver this system to him/her in a timely manner, then there is something
very wrong about what you are doing.

Because if your goal is to help speedup somebodies business process, then
your bet is to really have an easy to use system that is efficient in executing 
those sequential commands, that we call programs and be effective to the 
business / user that is using it.

Hence the triple E methodology (Easy, Efficient, Effective), which I believe
is a key factor to any system success
