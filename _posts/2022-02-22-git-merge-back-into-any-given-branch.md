Many times as team you branch of to implement new feature using git, and before you 
finalize your features some new changes are pushed to your base (origin) branch,
you are left with two options 
1. Go ahead and push your code for someone else to look at and fix while merging
2. Merge back into the origin branch and fix any problems that might arise, then push your code
